The **Delphi Detours Library** is a library allowing you to hook Delphi and Windows API functions. It provides an easy way to insert and remove hook.

Please check [Version2](https://github.com/MahdiSafsafi/delphi-detours-library/blob/wiki/Version2.md) wiki page
## Features : ##
  * Support **x86** and **x64** architecture.
  * Allow calling the original function via <u><b>Trampoline</b></u> function.
  * Support for <u><b>Multi Hook</b></u>.
  * **COM**/**Interfaces**/**win32api** support.
  * Support hooking interfaces methods by **MethodName** or **MethodIndex**.
  * Support COM **vtable** patching.
  * Fully <u><b>thread-safe</b></u> code hooking and unhooking.

  * The library does not use any external library.
  * The library can insert and remove the hook at any time.
  * The library contains InstDecode library, that allow to you to decode CPU instructions (x86 & x64).

This project contains two sub projects : **The Detours Library** and **the InstDecode library**.

The InstDecode Library is a library that can decode both (x86-x64) instructions. You can consider it as a small disassembler routine.
It can decode instruction and getting information about the instruction (size of instruction,displacement,immediate data, jump address,..) without displaying mnemonics making it very faster and small in compiled size.

These two libraries were coded in pure Pascal language with Delphi XE7.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/MahdiSafsafi/delphi-detours-library/tree/wiki) page for more information about how to use the library.
